"Stanza Go SDK" is the framework for adding Stanza Action control points using the Go language.

## Installation

Stanza's `sdk-go` can be installed like any other Go library via `go get`:

```shell

```

## Configuration

To use `sdk-go`, you'll need to import the `sdk-go` package and initialize it with
your local Stanza Hub and any other options.

## Usage

The SDK supports adding flow control, traffic shaping, concurrency limiting, circuit breaking, and adaptive system protection (via [Sentinel](https://github.com/alibaba/sentinel-golang)) to your service and externally managing the
configs with the Stanza Control Plane.

See samples to get started.

Documentation is available here. You can also find the API documentation here.
